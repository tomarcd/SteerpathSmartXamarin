/**
    SPSmartMapViewDelegate

    The 'SPSmartMapViewDelegate' protocol defines a set of optional methods that you can use to receive map-related update messages.
    Because many map operations require the 'SPSmartMapViewDelegate' class to load data asynchronously, the map view calls
    these methods to notify your application when specific operations complete.
